# Information Security Guide for Small and Medium Businesses

This repository is a practical, plain‑language guide to help small and medium businesses improve their cyber security, even if they do not have a dedicated security team.

It is written for non‑security analysts and managers who need to understand **what to do**, **why it matters**, and **how to implement basic controls step by step**.

---

## Who this guide is for

- Small and medium businesses (SMBs/SMEs), especially in Canada.  
- IT generalists and system administrators.  
- Business professionals in risk, compliance, finance, HR, operations and other areas who are responsible for security tasks but are not security experts.  
- Security professionals who need clear, non‑technical material to explain security to business stakeholders.

---

## What you will find here

- **Foundations** – simple explanations of core information security concepts.  
- **Where to start** – a basic risk assessment approach, a simple asset inventory and a 30‑day action plan.  
- **Practical controls** – focused guides on concrete controls (backups, patching, passwords and MFA, email and phishing, Wi‑Fi/VPN, device hardening, logging, vendor risk, etc.).  
- **Frameworks explained** – plain‑English introductions to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and CIS Critical Security Controls, tailored for SMBs.  
- **Policies** – starter policy templates managers can adapt and approve.  
- **Roadmaps** (planned) – suggested 3–6 month and 12‑month improvement plans.


The goal is to bridge the gap between **high‑level frameworks** and **day‑to‑day actions** in a small or medium business.

## How to get started (recommended path)

If you are new to information security in your organization:

1. **Read the overview**  
   - Start with `0-introduction/overview.md` to understand the purpose and scope of this guide.

2. **Learn the basics**  
   - Read `1-foundations/what-is-information-security.md` and `basic-principles.md` to get core concepts (CIA triad, least privilege, defense in depth).

3. **Understand your environment**  
   - Use `2-where-to-start/simple-asset-inventory.md` to list your key systems, data and processes.  
   - Use `2-where-to-start/basic-risk-assessment.md` to identify and prioritize your main risks.

4. **Act in the first 30 days**  
   - Follow `2-where-to-start/first-30-days.md` for a practical sequence of quick‑win actions.

5. **Implement key controls**  
   - Work through the relevant documents in `3-practical-controls/` (backups, patching, passwords/MFA, email/phishing, Wi‑Fi/VPN, etc.) to address your highest‑priority risks.

6. **Formalize expectations with policies**  
   - Use the templates in `policies/` and the guidance in `policies/README.md` to create and approve simple, realistic policies.

7. **Connect to frameworks (optional but recommended)**  
   - When you need to explain your approach to management, customers or auditors, use:
     - `4-frameworks-explained/nist-csf-for-smbs.md` as your high‑level map.  
     - `4-frameworks-explained/cis-controls-for-beginners.md` as your tactical checklist reference.

## Relationship to NIST CSF and CIS Controls

This repository is designed to align with widely used frameworks while staying pragmatic for small and medium businesses:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**  
  - `nist-csf-for-smbs.md` explains the six Functions (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) in plain language and shows where the content of this repo fits.

- **CIS Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls)**  
  - `cis-controls-for-beginners.md` describes the CIS Controls and highlights which IG1 (basic) safeguards are most relevant to SMBs.  
  - Many documents in `3-practical-controls/` map directly to IG1 safeguards (for example, assets, secure configuration, backups, malware defenses, access control, logging, vendor risk).

You can say, for example:

> “Our security program is based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and we use the CIS Critical Security Controls (Implementation Group 1) as a practical checklist for the controls we implement.”

The long‑term intention is for this repository to be a **living reference** for organizations that need to improve their security posture step by step, without assuming deep security expertise or large budgets.
