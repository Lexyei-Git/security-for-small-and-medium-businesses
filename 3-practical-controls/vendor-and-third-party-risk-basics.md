# Vendor and third‑party risk basics

Most small and medium businesses depend on vendors, cloud services, outsourced IT, and other partners.  
These third parties can improve efficiency and reduce costs, but they also introduce cyber and operational risks.

This document explains, in practical terms, how to think about vendor and third‑party risk and what a simple, realistic approach looks like for small and medium businesses.

You can use the template `templates/vendor-inventory-and-assessment.csv` to track your vendors and their risk profile.

## 1. What third‑party risk is (plain language)

**Third‑party risk** is the risk that something bad happens to your business because of a vendor, supplier, service provider, contractor or partner.

Examples:

- A cloud service storing your customer data suffers a data breach.  
- An outsourced IT provider is compromised and attackers use their access to reach your systems.  
- A critical software vendor has a long outage, stopping your operations.  
- A payment processor is hacked and customer payment information is stolen.

Customers usually **do not distinguish** between you and your vendors. If something goes wrong with a third party, they will still hold **your** business responsible.

## 2. Why this matters for small and medium businesses

Third‑party incidents are increasingly common and can be severe, especially for smaller organizations:

- Many Canadian businesses have experienced cyber events linked to vendors or the supply chain.  
- Small businesses often lack the resources to absorb the cost of major third‑party incidents (for example, legal fees, notifications, downtime, reputation damage).  
- Regulations and contracts may still hold you accountable for protecting customer data, even if a vendor was directly breached.

A basic third‑party risk approach can significantly reduce the chance that a vendor will become the weakest link in your security.

## 3. Step 1 – Know who your vendors are

You cannot manage what you do not know. Start with a simple **vendor inventory** using `templates/vendor-inventory-and-assessment.csv`:

- List key vendors, suppliers and service providers, including:
  - Cloud services (for example, email, file sharing, CRM, accounting, HR).  
  - IT and security service providers (for example, MSPs, hosting providers).  
  - Payment processors and e‑commerce platforms.  
  - Any vendor with remote access to your systems or physical access to your premises.

For each vendor, capture at least:

- Name and contact details.  
- What they do for you.  
- What data they handle (if any) and what systems they can access.  
- Whether they are critical to your day‑to‑day operations.

This can be maintained in a simple spreadsheet or table.

## 4. Step 2 – Classify vendors by risk

Not all vendors are equal. Focus more attention on third parties that can cause **greater harm** if something goes wrong.

A simple three‑tier model (use the **Risk Level** column in `templates/vendor-inventory-and-assessment.csv`):

- **High‑risk vendors**
  - Handle sensitive or regulated data (for example, customer personal data, payment information, health or financial data).  
  - Have administrative or remote access to your network or systems.  
  - Are critical for operations (if they stop, you cannot operate normally).

- **Medium‑risk vendors**
  - Provide important services but with limited access to sensitive data.  
  - Interruptions would cause inconvenience but not complete shutdown.

- **Low‑risk vendors**
  - Little or no access to sensitive data or internal systems.  
  - Easy to replace or work around in case of issues.

Use this classification to decide where to spend your limited time and effort.

## 5. Step 3 – Basic due diligence before you sign

For high‑ and medium‑risk vendors, perform **basic security and risk checks before you start using them**.

You do not need a complex questionnaire. Focus on a few key questions (use the **Security Certifications/Reports** and **Basic Security Due Diligence Done?** columns in the template):

- **Security basics**
  - Do they use strong authentication and MFA for staff and admin access?  
  - Do they have documented security policies and controls (for example, encryption, backups, patching)?  
  - Do they train their employees on security and privacy?

- **Data protection**
  - How do they store and protect your data (encryption at rest and in transit, access controls)?  
  - In which country or region is data stored?

- **Incident response**
  - Do they have an incident response process?  
  - Will they notify you promptly if they have a breach affecting your data?

- **Compliance and certifications**
  - Do they have relevant certifications or attestations (for example, SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS) where applicable?  
  - Are they subject to specific regulations that overlap with yours?

- **Business resilience**
  - How will they continue to operate during disruptions (for example, backups, disaster recovery plans)?

You can ask for:

- Security summaries, whitepapers or FAQs.  
- Copies of relevant reports or certificates (where reasonable).  
- Simple written answers to your key questions.

## 6. Step 4 – Put expectations into contracts

Contracts are where you formalize expectations and responsibilities.

For higher‑risk vendors, consider including clauses covering (track in the **Contract Includes Security/Privacy Clauses?** column):

- **Data protection**
  - Requirements for protecting your data (encryption, access control, retention and deletion).  
  - Limitations on how data may be used and shared.

- **Incident notification**
  - Obligations to notify you within a defined time if they experience a security incident or breach affecting your data.  
  - Requirements to cooperate with investigations and reporting.

- **Access and use**
  - Scope of access (which systems and data they can access, and for what purpose).  
  - Restrictions on subcontracting or use of additional third parties.

- **Compliance**
  - Expectations about complying with relevant laws, regulations and industry standards.

- **Termination and data return**
  - How your data will be returned or securely destroyed when the contract ends.

Work with legal counsel where needed, especially for higher‑risk relationships.

## 7. Step 5 – Monitor and review over time

Third‑party risk is not a one‑time check. Vendors, technologies and your own environment change over time.

For high‑ and medium‑risk vendors:

- **Review periodically**
  - Revisit their security posture and performance on a regular cycle (for example, annually or when major changes occur).  
  - Check whether there have been significant incidents, breaches or public issues.  
  - Update the **Review Frequency**, **Last Review Date** and **Next Review Date** columns in `templates/vendor-inventory-and-assessment.csv`.

- **Update classification**
  - If a vendor takes on new responsibilities or gains more access to your systems or data, reclassify them and increase scrutiny if needed.

- **Monitor dependencies**
  - Be aware of over‑reliance on a single vendor for critical services and consider alternatives or contingency plans.

For smaller organizations, this can be as simple as:

- A brief annual review of key vendors.  
- Monitoring news or advisories about critical suppliers.  
- Asking vendors to confirm that their security practices and certifications are still in place.

## 8. Third‑party risk and incident response

Your incident response plan should include **what to do if a vendor is compromised**.

Consider:

- **Notification and communication**
  - How you will be notified by the vendor.  
  - How you will inform affected customers, partners or regulators, if necessary.

- **Containment and access changes**
  - Temporarily limiting or revoking vendor access to your systems until the situation is understood.  
  - Changing credentials, API keys or integration tokens used by the vendor.

- **Investigations and evidence**
  - Coordinating with the vendor to understand what data and systems were affected.  
  - Preserving relevant logs and records on your side.

- **Lessons learned**
  - Reviewing whether your due diligence, contracts and monitoring need to be improved.

Cyber insurance providers may also have requirements and support processes specifically related to third‑party incidents.

## 9. Minimal checklist for vendor and third‑party risk

Use this checklist as a quick status check (you can also track progress in the `templates/vendor-inventory-and-assessment.csv`):

- [ ] We maintain a list of key vendors and service providers, including what they do and what data/systems they can access.  
- [ ] Vendors are classified by risk (for example, high, medium, low) based on data sensitivity, access level and business criticality.  
- [ ] For higher‑risk vendors, we perform basic security due diligence before signing (for example, questions about security, data protection, incident response and compliance).  
- [ ] Contracts with higher‑risk vendors include clear expectations for data protection, incident notification and termination/exit.  
- [ ] We review key vendors periodically to confirm that they continue to meet our security and operational expectations.  
- [ ] Our incident response procedures cover what to do if a vendor or third party is compromised.  
- [ ] Responsibilities for managing vendor risk are clear (for example, who owns the vendor inventory, who approves high‑risk vendors).

Unchecked boxes show where you can gradually strengthen your vendor and third‑party risk management over the next 3–12 months.
