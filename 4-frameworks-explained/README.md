# Frameworks explained

This folder contains plain‑English explanations of well‑known cybersecurity frameworks, **tailored for small and medium businesses (SMBs)**.

Each document explains:

- What the framework is and why it matters for SMBs.  
- Key concepts and structure in simple language.  
- How the practical controls in this repository **map to the framework**.  
- A realistic implementation approach for SMBs with limited resources.

## Available frameworks

| Framework | File | Focus |
|-----------|------|-------|
| [NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 for SMBs](nist-csf-for-smbs.md) | High‑level structure (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) with SMB implementation roadmap | Strategic planning and communication with leadership |
| [CIS Critical Security Controls for beginners](cis-controls-for-beginners.md) | 18 prioritized controls with Implementation Group 1 (IG1) focus for SMBs | Tactical checklist of concrete actions |

Both frameworks are complementary:

- **NIST CSF**: The **map** (high‑level structure for organizing and communicating cybersecurity efforts).  
- **CIS Controls**: The **checklist** (prioritized actions to implement within that structure).[web:241][web:144][web:201][web:260][web:333]

## NIST CSF vs CIS Controls: quick comparison

| Aspect | NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 | CIS Critical Security Controls v8.1 |
|--------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Level** | High‑level structure and language | Detailed, prioritized controls |
| **Structure** | 6 Functions (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover) → Categories → Subcategories | 18 Controls → Safeguards (IG1, IG2, IG3 levels) |
| **SMB focus** | Quick‑Start Guide for Small Business; scalable for any size | Implementation Group 1 (IG1) tailored for basic hygiene |
| **Best for** | Strategy, governance, communicating with executives/customers, compliance mapping | Tactical implementation, “what to do next” checklist |
| **Repository mapping** | [nist-csf-for-smbs.md](nist-csf-for-smbs.md) | [cis-controls-for-beginners.md](cis-controls-for-beginners.md) |
| **Use case** | “How are we doing overall?” / “What should we prioritize next year?” | “What specific controls should we implement this quarter?” |

**SMB recommendation**: Use **both** frameworks:
- NIST CSF for the **strategic map** and leadership communication.  
- CIS Controls for the **tactical checklist** of concrete actions.[web:241][web:201][web:260]

## How to use these documents

1. **For management and leadership**  
   - Read `nist-csf-for-smbs.md` to understand the big picture and communicate progress (“We are strong on Protect, working on Detect”).  
   - Use the Functions as a simple framework for annual planning.

2. **For IT and security implementers**  
   - Use `cis-controls-for-beginners.md` as a prioritized list of controls to implement.  
   - Cross‑reference with `3-practical-controls/` for implementation guidance.

3. **For risk and compliance**  
   - Both documents show how your practical controls map to recognized standards.  
   - Use for customer RFPs, audits or cyber insurance discussions.

4. **For roadmaps**  
   - Both frameworks are referenced in `5-maturity-roadmaps/` to show how your phased approach aligns with industry standards.

The long‑term intention is for this repository to be a living reference for organizations that need to improve their security posture step by step, without assuming deep security expertise or large budgets.
